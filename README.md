# React + Vite
This is a simple react based Game project in which you will have to choose a no and roll the dice, If your selected no matches with the random dice no then that no will be added to your total score else at each wrong guess there is this -2 points penalty.

Local Setup- 
Step-1 cd my-project

Step-2 npm install
Step-3 npm run dev

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
